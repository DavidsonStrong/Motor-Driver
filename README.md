# Motor-Driver
One Direction Motor Driver
## Overview
This Summer I started to work on projects pertaining to drone technology. One of these projects was this Unidirectional motor driver that can be ran by common microcontrollers such as Arduino and ESP32.
The driver can be safely supplied up to 5V at roughly 5A for four motors, each individually controlled from pwm inputs from the chosen microcontroller. The project was a success, however future iterations could be improved by reducing weight and size, specifically the flyback diodes which are overkill for the peak curent they experience from the motors.
